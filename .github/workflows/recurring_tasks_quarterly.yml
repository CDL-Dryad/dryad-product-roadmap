# Action to create tasks on a set schedule, from
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-issues-and-pull-requests/scheduling-issue-creation

# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# GitHub recommends pinning actions to a commit SHA.
# To get a newer version, you will need to update the SHA.
# You can also reference a tag or branch, but the action may change without warning.
